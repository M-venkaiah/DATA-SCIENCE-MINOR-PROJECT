In today's digital age, data has become the lifeblood of countless industries, driving decision-making processes, shaping strategies, and revolutionizing how businesses operate. At the heart of harnessing this data lies the interdisciplinary field of data science. Data science blends techniques from statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data, enabling organizations to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the fundamentals of data science, explore its various components, discuss its applications across diverse domains, and highlight its potential for transforming industries and societies. In my previous blog – “What is Data Science?” I discussed what Data Science means and why you should consider a career in Data Science. Data Science has come a long way. Data Scientists were once referred to as ‘business problem solvers’ who knew how to make sense of incoherent data clusters. Fast-forward to the present, Data Scientists are the most important resources for any business looking to thrive in this mad rush. They are now the ‘wizards of all problem solvers.’ This is the primary reason the syllabus of Data Science courses includes concepts that touch base on cloud computing, big data, natural language processing, and data sentiment analysis.


PROCESS OF A DIFFERENT DATA SCIENCE USED :

 A Data Scientist is responsible for deriving sensible outcomes from large data sets and enabling a business to make the right decision. These business decisions can be anything – from deciding whether to sell a new product chain or not to evaluating if a UI/UX change is required for an online business.

Main Components of Data Science Course Syllabus Let’s look in detail at each of the data science subjects, which entails the data scientist course syllabus: Programming Languages Programming is the backbone or foundation of data science. No data science project can see its daylight without knowing how to instruct the computer or machine to do the work. It is an essential element in the data science course syllabus bucket list. You must know how to extract or retrieve a particular set of records from a dataset to perform the necessary actions on it. The in-demand programming language for machine learning and deep learning is Python. It is an open-source scripting language that is easy to interpret. Along with data extraction, you must also know how to query and connect to a database. SQL is the mandatory query language for structured data, and NoSQL is for unstructured data. Statistics for Data Science Next on the checklist are statistics and mathematics. Statistics forms the basis of all the algorithms and techniques in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It is paramount to know how the data looks today in its present form and for which descriptive statistics are needed. Descriptive Statistics describes the data, such as the average price of a product; it further informs how the data is spread across average, if any, extremely large values. In other words, outliers exist in the data, and how the data must be treated when presented with missing values. Inferential statistics are used to determine if the sample from a set is representative of the population. Statistics provide various evaluation metrics, and the primary aim is to test the hypothesis or assumption. Mathematical Foundations for Data Science Some important concepts in the discipline of Mathematics, such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differentiation, Probability and Statistics, Vectors, and Matrices, are fundamental to machine learning and deep learning models. For better application of the respective algorithms, it is needed to have the basic knowledge and understanding of these foundational topics. Exploratory Data Analysis No data science project is complete without proper exploration and analysis of the data. It is important to present the data in a condensed form to a stakeholder and for one’s understanding and knowledge of what the data conveys. The common forms of visualizing data and its variables are univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis. Data Munging or Data Wrangling Another crucial step in the data science life cycle is to munge the data. The data pre-processing steps depend on the data type, whether text or numerical data. If text data is converted to binary, various categories of the data are created. 


CONTENT OF THE DATA SCIENCE :

Image data is recreated for more data points as deep learning models based on neural networks work efficiently on larger datasets. Data preprocessing also involves treating missing or null values, treating outliers, and transforming the variables. Machine Learning One of the most important, challenging, and time-consuming subjects in the data scientist syllabus (apart from programming) is learning Machine Learning. Without machine learning, data science is incomplete because it applies various statistical tools to make predictions and recommendations or suggestions based on the problem statement. Machine Learning is where all the other components of data science come into play at once and can increase the complexity of the model. It is branched into types of machine learning based on the data type. It determines which algorithms will be applicable in what scenario and problem. ML Ops The next important step after employing the methodologies for building models is to implement those models, known as Model Deployment or ML Ops. It is not only enough to build models but also to execute them and then only can solve the business problem. Data Dashboards and Storytelling A data scientist’s job profile is not limited to extracting, analyzing, and building models from the raw data. It also consists of presenting the results and inferences with proper documentation of the entire process from end to end. Tools such as Tableau and Power BI are used extensively for preparing dashboards and storytelling. Deep Learning Deep learning is the subset of Machine Learning. Deep learning models are complex as these are represented using a hierarchy of simpler concepts. It uses neural networks to process the data, learn patterns from it, and then predict the output. Biological neural networks inspire neural networks. These complex models require large amounts of data for processing and training. Deep learning is mostly used for unstructured text, images, and audio data. The primary difference between Machine Learning and Deep learning is that the deep learning models learn the hidden patterns and features present in the data. Whereas in the machine learning models, the data scientist determines the features. Big Data Big Data deals with huge volumes of data and that is mostly unstructured. Big data comprises data gathered from various sources such as text, audio, and images. Introducing big data in data science is to familiarize one with the tools, techniques, and strategies for handling big data and unstructured data. The aim of data scientists with big data is the same as extracting hidden patterns from the data. The Data Science syllabus can be divided into Soft Skills and Hard Skills. Soft skills include behavioral skills that help you put your idea on the table with sufficient explanation and convincing. Hard skills teach you to use all the tools and techniques to derive results from huge data sets. A perfect amalgamation of soft and hard skills is what enterprises seek in their in-house data scientists. Data Science Subjects The below-mentioned data scientist syllabus covers in-depth all the data science subjects topic-wise. Following are the subjects in data science that form the backbone of the data science course syllabus. A Data Science course syllabus consists of four major subject matters – Foundation blocks, Machine Learning, Text Mining, Natural language Processing, and Big Data Analytics. # Import necessary libraries import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Load the dataset data = pd.read_csv('house_data.csv') # Split data into features and target variable X = data.drop('price', axis=1) y = data['price'] # Split data into training and testing sets X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Initialize and train the linear regression model model = LinearRegression() model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Make predictions on the test set y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Evaluate the model mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print('Mean Squared Error:', mse) DATA SCIENCE FOUNDATIONS : Foundation Blocks The foundation rocks are Python and R. While Python programming language is the shining star of any Data Scientist course syllabus, R is referred to as the lingua franca of Data Science, i.e., a language that has been adopted as a common programming language. Any Data Science syllabus will be either in Python programming language with R or both. These two are the backbone of your data science course, but your foundation blocks are: Data handling and manipulation: Data handling is a process to ensure that data is safely stored or archived, or disposed of securely once the research concludes for any project. This includes developing stringent policies and methodologies to manage data handling digitally and through non-electronic means. On the other hand, data manipulation is altering data to make it easier to read, consume, or organize. For instance, organizing a data log alphabetically is an instance of data manipulation. Data wrangling and summarization: Data wrangling, also called data mugging, involves transforming and mapping data into another format from one ‘raw’ form. The purpose is to make the data appropriate and valuable for various uses. As the term suggests, data summarization is a conclusion you write down at the end of the code, declaring the final result. This comes in handy in data mining. This summary includes insights that indicate if the data is valuable or not. Descriptive analytics and visualization: Descriptive analytics help predict changes in a range of historical data. It helps in understanding such changes better. Data visualization is the power to create a visual representation of the data in various forms like bars, charts, lines, etc. Machine Learning Skills Machine learning is a key component of any Data Science syllabus. It involves mathematics and algorithm models to help students understand how a machine learns and adapts to everyday changes. Fundamental statistical concepts: Statistics is fundamental in any Data Science course syllabus. It is a powerful tool mostly used to perform technical data analysis. There are mainly five basic statistic concepts that all data science courses cover: Statistical features Probability distributions Dimensionality reduction Over and undersampling Bayesian Statistics You may also like to read: 1.

How to Start a Career in Data Science Communication skills and a problem-solving attitude form the crux of this job requirement. Even if you learn all the tools and technicalities, you will achieve very little if your soft skills are not polished. So, let’s begin with soft skills you must include in your Data Science syllabus. Critical Thinking Critical thinking forms an important and interesting crux of being a data scientist. As a Data Scientist, you must know how to look at a problem, frame appropriate questions, and understand how the results will transcend to business or into actionable items to pick up next. You are required to objectively analyze deeper than usual, create hypotheses, and predict results close to accuracy. Critical thinking is not something you mug up. It is about having a different perspective and understanding what resources are critical to solving the problem. Your opinions will be data-driven, and you must be taken into consideration all angles of the problem. Your key to developing this ability is curiosity. Curiosity A Data Scientist must be curious intellectually. You will need to ask questions that are overlooked in general. Your drive to search for answers with available data sources will set you apart. As a Data Scientist, you will never settle for ‘just enough’ because you are a creative thinker and always want to know more. Effective Communication You can be amazing with data, but it is a massive letdown if you cannot effectively communicate your ideas and analogies. A Data Scientist must have the confidence and elocution power to put all ideas on the table, discuss and justify all research, theories, and hypotheses, and effectively communicate their findings to technical and non-technical audiences. To be a successful Data Scientist, work on your communication skills. Business Acumen Your primary role as a Data Scientist is to deliver valuable insights from data. Unless you are in academia, business acumen is a vital soft skill. Every business has one goal – to drive profit, and for that, they need valuable details and accurate predictive business patterns from the data they capture. Your sharp business acumen will put you in a position to determine what performance models to apply and what kind of projects will catalyze the business from a financial perspective. To acquire this soft skill, you will need to focus on how a business functions, the financial key points, and what the competition is like. Problem-Solving Attitude Last (but not least), your attitude will determine how good you are as a Data Scientist. You will need to demonstrate your zeal to solve the problem no matter what. This, along with critical thinking, will lead you to become a successful data scientist. As Cary Fiorina says – If you torture the data, it will confess everything. What you need is to have the patience and determination to utilize data and make a way to solve the problem at hand. These skills, to some extent, depending on how you are. If you want to make a career in Data Science and learn all the hard skills, ensure you work on your soft skills. Now, let’s see the real picture. Hard skills in Data Science Syllabus are the subjects that all major courses include in their syllabus for Data Science. Data Science Course: Eligibility For a master’s degree, you must have a bachelor’s degree in one of the relevant disciplines – mathematics, computer science, computer applications, or equivalent. If you are a beginner, having a science background helps. You can opt for a data science career if you have a quantitative finance or business management background. For students with non-technical backgrounds, prior knowledge of basic analytics tools like Excel, SQL, or Tableau can be of great help in getting started with a Data Science course. For more details, follow our guide on how to get started for a Data Science career. Data Science and coding Not knowing to code is not a problem for anyone considering a data scientist career. It may be an add-on because it will make you more comfortable with the course materials, but not essential to kickstart your data science career. You are good to go if you are comfortable with the basic concepts like if-else, functions, programming logic, and loops. I have already debunked the myth that coding is essential for a data science career. Here are a few more frequently asked questions we’ll cover for you.

1. Introduction
In Python, decorators and generators are powerful tools that enhance the language's flexibility and efficiency. Decorators are used to modify the behavior of functions or methods without altering their code. Generators simplify the process of creating iterators, allowing for efficient looping over large data sets.

2. Decorators in Python
2.1 Definition and Purpose
Decorators are a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. They are often used for logging, enforcing access control, instrumentation, caching, etc.

2.2 How Decorators Work
A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. This is achieved using the @decorator_name syntax before the function to be decorated.

2.3 Types of Decorators
Function Decorators: Modify functions or methods.
Class Decorators: Modify classes.
2.4 Examples of Decorators
python
Copy code
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
3. Generators in Python
3.1 Definition and Purpose
Generators are a simple way of creating iterators. They use the yield statement to return data during iteration and can be paused and resumed, which makes them memory efficient.

3.2 How Generators Work
Generators are defined using the def keyword, but instead of return, they use yield. Each call to the generator's __next__() method resumes from where it last left off.

3.3 Benefits of Generators
Memory Efficiency: Generators are lazy iterators, computing values on the fly and thus saving memory.
Simplified Code: They simplify the writing of iterators.
3.4 Examples of Generators
python
Copy code
def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

counter = count_up_to(5)
for num in counter:
    print(num)
4. Minor Project: Implementing Decorators and Generators

def logging_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling function {func.__name__} with arguments {args} and {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@logging_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(3, 4))
File Reader Generator:

python
Copy code
def read_large_file(file_path, chunk_size=1024):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        while True:
            chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            yield chunk

for chunk in read_large_file('large_file.txt'):
    print(chunk)
4.4 Code Explanation
The logging decorator logs the name of the function, its arguments, and its return value.
The file reader generator reads a file in chunks, making it suitable for handling large files without loading them entirely into memory.
4.5 Results and Discussion
The logging decorator successfully logs function calls and results, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
